# Roam Flutter SDK Example

Demonstrates how to use the roam_flutter plugin.

***NOTE***
In the current release, location listener only works in foreground and background state. In order to receive locations in flutter side for terminated state, listener needs to be implemented with a flutter isolate or any background service library.
We are working on improving our flutter SDK to support listener for terminated state.

To receive locations from native modules, refer to our native Android and iOS SDK docs.
